# Kanger_soil
First attempt to use GitHub as a database for all scripts, notes and files I am using to create several geographical maps in the Kangerlussuaq area in South West Greenland. These maps will form the basis for one of the objectives of my PhD project.

I don't have any experience with coding and am here to learn and explore all that I can do with my data to make it even more valuable.
